# helidon-labs
This project holds the code for the start of labs position of the Cloud Test Drive Helidon lab.

The code here is intended to be imported into Eclipse, then follow the instructions in the cloud test drive to develop it.

## Helidon coding lab only

From a development perspective this code was built using the following, though later versions will probabaly work I haven't tested them

  - Maven 3.6
  - Java 11.0.5 2019-10-15 LTS
  - Eclipse 2020-06 - 4.16.0
  - curl 7.64.1 
  - Oracle JDBC drivers (installed in you maven repo) v10

## Docker lab

  - Docker 19.3.12
  
You will also need access to a Unix bash shell if you are going to use the scripts

## Kubernetes lab

These are known to run in Kubernetes 1.16 on the Oracle Cloud

If you are following the lab instructions then you can of course run them on your local system, but an OCI Tenancy using the cloud shell will make things a lot easier for you.
